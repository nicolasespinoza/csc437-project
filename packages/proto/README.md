## Project Concept
As an avid music lover, I have ~30 music posters in my room. Frequently throughout the year, I rotate many of them out to have
my latest favorites. However, because I feel so moved by music and the music I really enjoy in particular, I design the posters myself.
Since I am no graphic artist, I have a consistent theme across all of the posters. When it comes time to make one for 
the latest album I like, all I have to do is replace the "guts" of the poster (the poster data, e.g. album name, artist name, tracklist, etc.)
which has increasingly become a hassle. During busy parts of the school year, I frequently put off the task of the poster generation, while
still very much wanting to put up new posters.

As such, while brainstorming what project to create for this course, I immediately thought of a way to automate my poster creation.
Through APIs like that of Spotify or Apple Music, I can easily pull all of an album's data by just identifying the album by name and artist.
However, connecting to music APIs is likely only the easier part of the project, while the rest would be primarily image generation at scale (of which I have no experience).

I envision a form-like interface where a user can find an album by search term (e.g. "abbey road the beatles") and immediately watch the poster generate in front of them,
with the album data, correct colors, and high resolution - all ready to print. In addition, I would want it to be fully customizable
to account for minor things I frequently change when making a new music poster (e.g. removing the 'Deluxe' text if it is present).

As I have decided that this will be my project for this course, I have made multiple HTML files, each being a component
of what will eventually be this form-like interface. I should note that what I have created thus far is mostly conceptual, my actual posters
look much nicer and will take more experience with CSS before they look even remotely the same !
